    <h3>captain and owner of Serenity</h3>

    <div class="Biography">
      <p>
        Malcolm Reynolds was born on the planet Shadow and was raised by his mother on a ranch, along with 40 ranchhands. He joined the Browncoats in the war against the Alliance. He was a sergeant in the army and recieved an award for his valor in the battle of Serenity Valley. After the war, Mal wanted nothing more than to get as far away from the Alliance as possible so he bought a Firefly class transport and named her Serenity. He brought Zoe along as his first mate, then hired a pilot (Wash), a mechanic (Bester, who was later replaced by Kaylee, see Kaylee's bio), and rented out one of his shuttles to a Companion (Inara). He later aquired a gun hand (Jayne) and then picked up passengers on Persephone (Book, Simon and River). Mal will do any job, "Don't much care what it is" as long as the money's good or the job's interesting. While he's being hunted by the Alliance because of River and Simon, he still manages to take a few jobs (one right under the Alliance's nose [see "Ariel"]).

        <h5>Relationships:</h5>
        <li>Zoe Washburne: Although not a romantic relationship by any means, the two are very close. They fought and survived a war together; indeed, their closeness sometimes makes Wash, Zoe's husband, jealous. As Joss Whedon said in the DVD commentary for Serenity, Zoe is "the one person [Mal] can count on the most."

        <li>Inara Serra: A Companion who hires one of Serenity's shuttles as a home/transportation, thus increasing the potential client base of both herself and Serenity's crew; unresolved romantic/sexual tension between she and Mal is one of the character arcs of the series.

        <li>Kaylee Frye: Serenity's long-suffering mechanic, Kaylee and Mal seem to have an older brother/younger sister relationship. Mal serves as a protective influence for Kaylee in times of physical and emotional danger, while she reminds him that people can be good.

        <li>Jayne Cobb: A mercenary who was hired away from a criminal gang that was, at that moment, in the process of robbing Mal and Zoe, Jayne is loyal to whomever offers him the best payment. Though he seems to afford Mal a greater deal of respect than mere economics, the two frequently argue over the proper course of action to take. 

        <li>Derrial Book: Although Mal initially disdained the preacher due to his loss of faith in Serenity Valley, Mal nevertheless became relatively close to Book; when Book was dying after an attack by the Operative, Mal assured the Shepherd that he was as much a part of the crew as anyone.

        <li>Simon Tam: Simon and Mal frequently come into conflict when responding to things River has done, but Mal nonetheless respects Simon's strong devotion to his sister and his skills as a doctor. Mal uses those skills to rationalize Simon's continued presence on Serenity.

        <li>River Tam: Mal has very little patience for River. While he has sympathy for her condition, she also poses a threat to his crew and his ship. The two come to a grudging respect by the end of Serenity, but it takes a long time to get there.
